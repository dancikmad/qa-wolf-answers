As a recent graduate in electrical and electronics engineering,
I aim to transition into software development. This position is particularly enticing
to me due to my past experience in QA engineering back in 2015. During that time,
I oversaw the administration of an online GTA RPG game spread across 14 servers,
serving a player base of 20,000 individuals.
My responsibilities included maintaining automated tests on both the development
and testing servers, as well as enhancing the game's interactivity by implementing new features.
I actively troubleshooted bugs in the early stages of development, collaborating closely
with C++ and C# developers to address issues promptly. Additionally,
I contributed to the construction of development pipelines,
facilitating the smooth transition of code from the development server to the production server.

I am drawn to the opportunity at QA Wolf because of the company's
primary objective of identifying and resolving bugs early on, thereby reducing costs
and enhancing the maintainability and efficiency of the codebase. I want to empasize
my desire to contribute to QA Wolf that is making a tangible difference in software development
landscape by heping teams ship confidently and improve the overall customer experience.

Having the chance to work remotely allows me to achieve a better work-life balance.
Working from the comfort of my home, surrounded by my desktop setup equipped with three monitors,
a laptop, and a powerful desktop computer, I am highly skilled and effective in delivering
quality work efficiently.

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to join the dynamic team at QA Wolf.
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of
contributing to the company's continued success and growth.
